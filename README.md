# Advent of Code 2024 - @jatkinson1000

## Overview

"Advent of code is a great way to learn a new language" I regularly say to others, so
let's see how true this is after dabbling in the introduction to Rust tutorials...

Not intending to be competitive this year, but rather a learning experience, so will
try and stay away from looking at the local leaderboards.
